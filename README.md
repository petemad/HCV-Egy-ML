# HCV-Egy-ML

# 2 features for each KNN(10) classifier, apply polynomial of degree 4
majority accuracy = ranges from 22% to 44 % in four classes while tha max accuracy was 33 %

# 2 features // //  // , ploynomial of degree 8
features 216 and 494 ==> accuracy = 65% for 2 classes (best estimator)


# accuracy 31 % on four classes based 3 features that have the highest std_dev from
KNN(3)
